This repository is a collection of Python scripts related to accessing and analyzing collector probe data, OEDGE/3DLIM/SOLPS plotting GUIs and routines, common DIII-D data analysis such as loading and filtering Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data. See the README in each folder for descriptions of how to use the scripts.

## cp
Contains files related to accessing collector probe data and collector probe relevant tasks.

## lim
Contains the 3DLIM plotting GUI to help vizualize 3DLIM output.

## oedge
Contains the OEDGE (DIVIMP) plotting GUI to help vizualize OEDGE output.

## solps
Contains the SOLPS-ITER plotting scripts. This is still a work in progress, but the basic bones are there.

## tools
Contains useful tools related to DIII-D data access, such as pulling and filtering Langmuir probe or Thomson scattering data.

## misc
Contains collection of miscellaneous scripts related to structuring LAMS experimental data.
